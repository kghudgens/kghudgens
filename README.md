### Hello, I'm Kevin HudgensðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a python expense tracker that exports user input into a GUI.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ways to use javascript on my future full stack projects.  
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating a portfolio of quality projects for the job hunt.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about living in Japan.   
âš¡ Fun fact: I have been living in Japan for the last 7 years, but will move back to the United States once I become a professional Software Engineer.
