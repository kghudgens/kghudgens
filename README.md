### Hello, I'm Kevin HudgensðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer with a Bachelor of Science in Software Development and Security, currently working for a Defense company in the Midwest.

After gaining more experience in software engineering, I plan to return to Japan. I lived there for eight years in my previous field and look forward to returning as a Software Engineer. 

I am currently using the project Pokeget_Node to learn both Nodejs and ReactJs.
