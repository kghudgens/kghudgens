### Hello, I'm Kevin HudgensðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my new Java project The Student Management System and Django project Option House.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about JavaScript. I soon plan to create some projects working with the React framework, so a better understanding of JavaScript is necessary.  
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating a portfolio of quality projects for the job hunt.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about living in Japan.   
âš¡ Fun fact: I have been living in Japan for the last 7 years, but will move back to the United States once I become a professional Software Engineer.
