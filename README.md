### Hello, I'm Kevin HudgensðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my web applications Stack and PyQuiz.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ins and outs of django.  
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating a portfolio of quality projects for the job hunt.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about living in Japan.   
âš¡ Fun fact: I have been living in Japan for the last 7 years, but will move back to the United States once I become a professional Software Engineer.
