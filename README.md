### Hello, I'm Kevin Hudgens👋


🔭 I’m currently working on my web application PyQuiz.  
🌱 I’m currently learning more about java, data structures, and algorithms.  
🤔 I’m looking for help with creating a portfolio of quality projects for the job hunt.  
💬 Ask me about living in Japan.   
⚡ Fun fact: I have been living in Japan for the last 7 years, but will move back to the United States once I become a professional Software Engineer.
